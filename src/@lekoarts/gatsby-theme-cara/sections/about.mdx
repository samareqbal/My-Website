## About

I was born and brought up in the city of Ranchi the capital of Jharkhand. I spent my entire childhood in Ranchi and went to DPS as a kid, so yes my childhood was filled with weed (my fellow dipsites will understand). The one thing i learned from DPS is how to bunk classes and never get caught while doing so.I was also in the school Basketball team.I made some great friends there some of them even helped me in creating this website. I am currently in Pune (Maharashtra) and I'm a student in MITWPU 2nd year (at the time of making of this website). I'll add more content to this Website and this section as life goes on so until next time.......!!!!
